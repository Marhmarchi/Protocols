## Bl21 transformation

### Materials

  * distilled water
  * sterile 15ml tubes
  * sterile 1.5ml tubes
  * calcium chloride
  * syringe + syringe filter
  * LB broth
  * LB agar plate + appropriate antibiotic 
  * Innoculation loop
  * Sterile spreader
  * Bunser burner or torch
  * Pipettes/tips
  * 15ml centrifuge
  * 1.5ml centrifuge
  * heat block
  * Ice bath
  * shaking/rotating incubator


### stock prep

  -Prepare a 1M calcium chloride solution by dissolving 1.1g in 10ml of water
  -transfer 1ml of this solution to a fresh tube and add 9ml of distilled water
  -filter sterilize into a fresh tube. 
  -Label the result "transformation buffer"

### transformation

#### Day 1
  -The day before performing the transformation protocol, innoculate 10ml of LB broth in a 15ml tube with BL21 cells, or any other ecoli variety
  -place into rotating/shaking incubator at 37C and let grow overnight

#### Day2
  -Innoculate 10ml of fresh LB with 100ul of overnight solution
    - Let grow for exactly 2H (do not let overgrow)
  -Pellet cells by centrifugation at max speed for 2-3 minutes (4500rpm was used on my centrifuge)
  -Decant off liquid and resuspend pellet in 1ml transformation buffer
  -Transfer liquid to 1.5ml tube
  -Pellet cells at 12000rpm for 30 seconds
  -Pipette off liquid, do not disutrb pellet
  -Add 1ml of transformation buffer and resuspend by pipetting gently
  -Pellet again at 12000rpm for 30 seconds
  -Pipette off liquid
  -The pellet should contain enough cells for 3-4 reactions. Add 100ul of transformation buffer for the number of reactions you wish to perform (100-400ul)
    - If doing more than 1 reaction, seperate liquid into 100ul aliqotes in seperate tubes
  -Add 50-400ug of DNA to each tube (50 for easy plasmids/strains, 400 for stubborn ones. Adjust as needed)
  -incubate mixutre in a fridge (5C) for 25 min
  -Preheat heatblock to 42C
  -After incubation in the fridge heat shock cells in heat block for exactly 90s
  -immeditaly chill in ice bath after heat shocking for 3-5 min
  -Add 1ml of fresh LB to each tube, and allow to recover in an incubator at 37C for 1-2H with shaking/rotation

If using turbo or other easy strains:
  -plate 100ul of recovered solution on appropriate antibiotic or selection plates
  -spread using sterile spreader or innoculation loops

If using BL21:
  -Pellet cells by centrifugation at 12000rpm for 10s
  -plate entire pellet + 100ul of media
  -spread using sterile spreader or innoculation loop

  -Incubate plate at 37C for 2-3 days until colonies develop
